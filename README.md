## Introduction

This page was built to learn and practice using `CSS GRID` and `normalize.css` to match spec guidelines layed out [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/m1-static-comp).

## Setup

To get started on this project: 

1. should fork this repo - on the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button.
2. Clone down the repo by opening your terminal and running `git clone [remote-address]`
3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies by running `npm install` in your terminal.
4. Run `open index.html` in the terminal to see the page. 
5. Profit?

## Features

The page shows a list of shared playlists with links to those playlists. Of course, the page is currently all bark and no bite, as there is no functionality (no JavaScript) to go with the page, only and HTML page styled with CSS. 

The playlists are displayed on cards that are arranged using CSS Grid so that each newly added card will fall into the same display pattern. 

The page also features responsive design. At screen breakpoints, the elements of the page rearrange to show a new layout. At full screen size, the card grid features 4 columns and the icons in the header include titles. However, at smaller screens sizes the grid will display 2 columns or 1 column and the icon titles disappear. 

The page also features `normalize.css`. Normalize helps the page to be similarly formatted across browsers. 

#### 

#### Continuous Improvement/Future Improvements
 In the next iteration I hope to add:
  * Images to go with the cards
  * a customized `normalize.css` file
  * a dropdown menu with different views with the admin username arrow at the top right of the page
